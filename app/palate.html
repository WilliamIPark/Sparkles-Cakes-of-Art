            At Sparkles Cakes of Art we are passionate about our flavours and
            ingredients. All of our cakes and sweet treats are made fresh to order
            using the finest ingredients. Our menus are a carefully chosen selection
            of our most popular flavours but we are happy to tailor flavours to suit
            your requirements!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our cakes contain three perfect layers of cake interspersed with three
            generous layers of filling, carefully assembled so they look exquisite
            when cut. Cakes can be coated with buttercream in a variety of textures
            or with a layer of chocolate ganache and then fondant icing for a flawless
            finish.
